Capstone idea \#3 

## Problem
Assessing Cancer incidence and mortality in the United States

## Client Description and Potential Usage
Policy makers, public health planners and others may be interested in how cancer affects mortality rates geographically. Having this
detailed report would allow them to monitor the burden of disease and to implement cancer prevention and control programs.

## Data Acquisition
Datasets for the incidence and mortality rates in the US are located at Centers for disease control:
(https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/download_data.htm) The dates available
are from 1999-2013. Data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet the data quality criteria for 
all invasive cancer sites combined. Rates cover approximately 99% of the U.S. population.
CDC WONDER is a public service developed and operated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of United States 
federal government. The public web site at http://wonder.cdc.gov is in the public domain, and only provides access to public use data 
and information. You may access the information freely, and use, copy, distribute or publish this information without additional or 
explicit permission. Please do provide a citation to credit the authors and/or data providers. When referring to a written article or 
document, please cite the item as you would any other document on the world wide web.

Also the datasets from HDW (HRSA Data Warehouse) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
(https://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/Tools/DataPortal.aspx) can be used by sorting by Healthcare Facilities and then under served medical 
locations. Checking for areas that are potentially high risk from being under served medically. 

## Approach
Data acquistion: current data detailed above (More could be added in final report)
Data wrangling: CDC - Creation of data frames from flat text files, editing, creating and cross referencing variables from 
mulitple datasets and potential location based data integrated from HRSA. More TBD.    
Exploratory data analysis: Statistically and Visually tell the data story...

## Deliverables
GitHub: Code for the project in R markdown including documentation.
Paper explaining the problem, the approach and conclusions, Slide deck covering the same material as the final report.
Present the project to the online springboard community either in an office hour or online video.
